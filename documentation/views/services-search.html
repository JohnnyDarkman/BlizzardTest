<h1>services/search.js</h1>

<p>
	This defines a singleton service which keeps track of the current search state
	for the entire application. This service assumes that there is one "primary"
	or "global" search that the application is dealing with. This service is designed
	to act as a sync for other services and view models which can require the "search"
	service as a dependency.
</p>
<p>
	The service responds to route updates and offers a "load more" feature which 
	queries the next page of results in place of regular paging.
</p>
<p>
	This was originally all written in the search view model as a first pass and then
	hastily separated out during a quick clean up pass before submission. Sadly, time
	constraints kept me from doing a proper refactor here.
