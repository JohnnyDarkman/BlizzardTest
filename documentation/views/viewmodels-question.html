<h1>viewmodels/question.js</h1>
<p>
	This view model (like profile) is a bit messy as well. It also contains code that
	would be more correctly placed in a service. The size and lack of complexity to
	this view model is what made me decide to afford less time making this pretty.
</p>
<p>
	The view model exposes bindings (and queries data for) detailed question information
	and queries all associated answers. For the most part the data is left as it is
	received and the view is able to bind directly with minimal (no) transformation.
