<h1>viewmodels/tag-cloud.js</h1>
<p>
	What makes this view model cool is it is expected to be a nested/child view model.
	It reads the "tags" binding off of its parent view model and transforms the data
	to support the tag-cloud partial view. Of course if your parent does not expose
	a "tags" binding then shame on you.
</p>
<p>
	This view model uses the "watch" feature on the parent view model to bind a handler
	to change events on the "tags" member.
