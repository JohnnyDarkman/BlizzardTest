<h1>viewmodels/auth.js</h1>
<p>
	This viewmodel manages bindings and syncs with the "services/auth.js" service.
	It can also be used as a parent view model to provide auth bindings and information
	to other nested view models.
</p>
<p>
	The auth view model provides two command handlers "login" and "logout" which operate
	the underlying auth service to manage the user's authentication state.
<p>
<p>
	The view model keeps in sync with the service using the listen feature provided by the
	view object which will unsubscribe from the broadcast channel when the view is destroyed.
