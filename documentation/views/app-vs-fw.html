<h1>What is App and what is Framework?</h1>

<p>
	When looking at the source code of my project you will find in the "application/scripts"
	folder that I have broken things out into two folders. The "application/scripts/application"
	folder contains all application specific code which would normally be the only code written
	if you were to reuse this framework. The "application/scripts/framework" folder contains all
	of the framework code which would not likely be rewritten or altered per project.
