<h1>viewmodels/profile.js</h1>
<p>
	I'll be honest, this view model is a mess. This was one of the last items to go in
	and includes logic that would better fit in a service.
</p>
<p>
	The view model exposes bindings (and queries data for) various user profile data if
	the currently logged in account contains a profile. If there is no profile a cheap
	looking modal will be displayed alerting the user that they are "Userless". If there
	is no logged in user another modal will be shown alerting the user they must first
	log in before viewing this page. This modal can only be seen by accessing the URI
	of the page directly. There will be no page links made available to this page while
	the user is logged out.
</p>
<p>
	Should the user log out while on this page they will be redirected back to the default
	hash path (empty). This will ultimately bring them back to the search page.
