<h1>services/bindings.js</h1>
<p>
	The bindings extension adds binding functionality to the framework. This is the part
	of the framework that is responsible for watching the DOM, managing "Views" and
	triggering/managing bindings. This is the most important part of the framework.
</p>
<p>
	This extension operates by watching DOM mutations, creating "Views" for elements that
	have bindings, and then making sure that associated objects are properly disposed of
	as content leaves the DOM.
</p>
<p>
	When an element is added that contains a registered binding (attribute) it will trigger
	the creation of a View which is passed to the binding code through dependency injection.
	"Views" are nested based on their hierarchy on the page layout. A View has access to its
	parent and children as do the bindings associated with them.
</p>
<p>
	Bindings can effect their environment in a few different ways. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Any binding can add to the "scope" of the View by exposing a "scope" property set to 
		an object with named dependency instances.
		<code><pre>
Application.extend.binding(function() {
   this.scope = { 
      myDependency: 
      'This string will be injected into any child/nested bindings if requested as a dependency'
   };
});
		</pre></code>
	</li>
	<li>
		Disposal tasks that should occur when the view is destroyed can be added to the View's
		disposal chain by exposing a "dispose" property set to a disposal function.
		<code><pre>
Application.extend.binding(function() {
   this.dispose = function() { console.log('I am disposed!'); }
});
		</pre></code>
	</li>
	<li>
		Disposal tasks can also be added directly to the View object by setting the dispose
		property to a disposal task.
		<code><pre>
Application.extend.binding(['view', function(view) {
   view.dispose = function() { console.log('I will be disposed first'); };
   view.dispose = function() { console.log('I will be disposed second'); };
}]);
		</pre></code>
	</li>
	<li>
		A binding can prevent the binding process at a View and its descendants until it is ready.
		<code><pre>
Application.extend.binding(function() { // The pre-scan method below must not return false to get here
   console.log('This message will never happen.');
   
}, function(view) { // This is a "pre-scan" function that is passed only the View
   console.log('Because I am returning false here you will never see the above message.');
   return false;
});
		</pre></code>
