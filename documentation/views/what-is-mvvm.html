<h1>Why MVVM?</h1>

<p>
	I chose to go with MVVM over MVC because I think it is a better fit to front-end
	web frameworks. Because the framework is so close to the view in this technology
	stack it makes sense to be concerned with view-state in your code. It also presents
	a much nicer separation of concerns for the view itself which need only define 
	bindings to a view-model in this pattern. This keeps code out of the view and 
	that's a good thing for everyone concerned.
