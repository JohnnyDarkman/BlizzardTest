<h1>init.js</h1>

<p>
	Here you will find the application startup code. This file instantiates an "Application"
	and exposes it globally. It is also responsible for setting up application routing.
	The route settings here will respond to hash paths and load the registered partial pages
	into an element attributed with "data-routed".
</p>
<p>
	Additionally I have thrown in some dirty code to just make sure the app has not been
	throttled by Stack Exchange. I am also configuring a communication setting which will
	add my app's key to any call made to Stack Exchange which will greatly increase the 
	number of calls your IP will be able to make using my APP.
</p>
<p>
	The documentation is also using this functionality which can be viewed on this page and
	in "documentation/scripts/app.js".
