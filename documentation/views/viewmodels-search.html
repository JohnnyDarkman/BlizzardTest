<h1>viewmodels/search.js</h1>
<p>
	This view model manages bindings and syncs with the "services/search.js" service.
	It can also be used as a parent view model to provide search bindings and information
	to other nested view models.
</p>
<p>
	The auth view model provides two command handlers "search" and "next" which operate
	the underlying search service to manage the application's current search results.
<p>
<p>
	The search feature operates a little strange by setting the hash query instead of
	calling the search service directly. This should be cleaned up in an imaginary future
	release that will never happen.
</p>
<p>
	The view model keeps in sync with the service using the listen feature provided by the
	view object which will unsubscribe from the broadcast channel when the view is destroyed.
