<h1>core.js</h1>
<p>
	Aptly named, Core.js is probably one of the least interesting parts of my framework. 
	It provides very basic functionality to support dependency management and extending 
	functionality. Anything of interest can be found in the framework/services and
	framework/bindings folder.
</p>
<p>
	The Application constructor here is usually all you will worry about as a consumer
	of this framework. Once you instantiate an "Application" you can start adding view
	models and functionality to your page.
</p>
<p>
	If you are looking to add customizations you can use the .extend() function prior
	to instantiation. Extending the application in this way will offer you a chance to
	edit the application object before it is locked down. This type of extension should
	normally only be used for core functionality.
</p>
<p>
	More often you will be looking to add new bindings to your application. This is
	accomplished using the "Application.extend.binding()" function added by the 
	binding.js extension. Use this prior to constructing "Application" to add a new
	binding.
</p>
<p>
	To start your application you will need to instantiate a new "Application" object.
</p>
<code><pre>var myApplication = new Application(document)</pre></code>
<p>
	The passing of a node marks the root element your application will operate at.
	It is possible to have multiple applications running on the same page but is not
	recommended and applications should never be nested. If there was to be future
	implementations of this framework I would add some blocking to this.
