<h1>services/broadcast.js</h1>
<p>
	The broadcast service is a singleton that coordinates subscriptions
	by channel to a global message handler. This is useful when coordinating
	unrelated sections of your view to react to global changes in your application's
	state. For example when the user logs in or out.
</p>
<p>
	The broadcast service is also integrated into Views and ViewModels which will auto
	unsubscribe when being disposed.
</p>
<p>
	Broadcast very simply exposes 3 functions: subscribe, unsubscribe, and send.
	subscribe and send both accept a key or channel to be used as a filter for listeners.
	The unsubscribe function accepts only a previously assigned callback which will then
	be disassociated from any subscription made using the same instance of callback.
