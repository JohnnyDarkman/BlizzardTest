<h1>View Models <small>and the view-model binding</small></h1>

<p>
	View-Model is a blocking binding meaning if the code for a specified view model
	has not yet been loaded the element being bound and all of its descendents will
	postpone binding until the view model is ready.
</p>
<p>
	Once the view model has been loaded and is ready binding will continue and
	the view-model will be passed down to descendent and sibling bindings as a
	dependency. Most other bindings expect a viewmodel to be present and used as
	the model that will be interacted with.
</p>
<p>
	A view-model is newly constructed each time it is referenced in your markup.
	View models are observable objects and so all values must be added to the view
	model when it is being constructed. New member will not be added to the view
	model after it has finished being constructed.
</p>
<p>
	In order to observe property changes on a view model before it has finished 
	constructing you can add your own notify, observe, and unobserve methods to
	the view model that will act like interceptors.
</p>
<code><pre>
app.viewmodel('my-view-model', function() {
   this.notify = function(name) { console.log(name + ' was updated!'); }
});
</pre></code>
<p>
	All values set on a view model will be converted to properties after construction
	is complete and the view model itelf will be frozen from any further changes. You
	should try to avoid defining actual properties or doing anything that might 
	interfere with this process. Unless, of course, you like broken applications.
</p>
<p>
	A ".parent" property will be added to a view model after it has been constructed.
	If you need access to the parent view model before that time you can have it injected.
</p>
<code><pre>
app.viewmodel('my-view-model', ['viewmodel', function(parent) {
	console.log(parent); // this is the parent view model
}]);
</pre></code>
<p>
	A ".watch(path, callback)" method will be added to the view model after it has been
	constructed. This is usefull when creating custom bindings that need to watch direct 
	or remote observable properties starting from the view model. There is no way to 
	configure a watch on a view model before it has finished construction. 
</p>
<code><pre>
Application.extend.binding('my-binding', ['viewmodel', function(viewmodel) {
   viewmodel.watch('my.distant.value', function() { console.log('Updated!'); });
}]);
</pre></code>
