					<header><strong>Wait... why did you use raw CSS?</strong></header>
					<p>
						Firstly the requirements were that this project should demonstrate my skills
						at creating good, clean semantic markup. This becomes rather difficult when 
						using some of the popular styling frameworks out there as they tend to break
						best practices. Markup's primary job should be to define and organize content.
						Many styling frameworks force you to clutter your views with massive amounts
						of excess markup that only exist to enforce presentation of your content.
						What this means is if you ever want to alter the way something is presented
						you can't without reorganizing your views to do so. Realistically it is not
						possible to maintain this purist approach just due to the limitations of the 
						technology, but that does not mean good practices should be completely abandoned.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because of this I chose to model my styling to my markup rather than let it
						drive the design of my pages. I took this approach solely to demonstrate
						(or attempt to demonstrate) my ability to identify and apply good practices.
						I realize that this is not practical in a real-world team environment where
						the efficiency of maintaining your own custom framework while trying to pump
						out and maintain applications can often be costly to a business.
					</p>

					<header><strong>why Why WHY did you make yet ANOTHER custom JS Framework???</strong></header>
					<p>
						Again, my purpose here is to demonstrate what I am capable of. Sure, I could show
						you how little code I can get away with writing in a standard Angular app - OR
						I could show you that I am capable of writing a complete(ish), functional
						framework from scratch with raw javascript. In both situations you can observe
						my ability to follow good (I hope good?) practices and create small, maintainable
						application code. With this approach you also get to dive deeper into my abilities
						and get a better feel for me as a developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						I realize that this approach gives you A LOT of stuff to look at so I have taken
						the liberty of writing up some quick documentation on both the custom framework
						and the application code. This should help walk you through it all and assist in
						separating out what is framework and what is application.
					</p>
				</article>

					<header><strong>So, how does this help evaluate your skills exactly?</strong></header>
					<p>
						For the styling I tried to demonstrate a base-page structure that attaches to
						a semantic layout that could be easily inherited down into a theme. Themes are then
						able to stack directly on top of the base framework layout and each other in order
						to create a flexible theming/skinning architecture. This is the supposed goal of
						"perfect-world" frameworks. While this is admittedly nothing like something
						you might find in a perfect world it hopefully can offer you a good idea about
						my practices as an engineer without any of the extra clutter of something like
						bootstrap in the way.
					</p>
					<p>
						The custom JS framework is modeled after another very popular framework. The idea
						is that even though there will be some changes between this custom framework and
						Angular you should still be able to observe my application code in an environment
						similar to one you are already familiar with. The added benefit here is that you
						also get to see me do something as crazy as write a custom framework from scratch.
					</p>

					<header><strong>You said something about documentation?</strong></header>
					<p>
						At the top of the page you will find page links to get to the
						<a href="./index.html">project</a>,
						<a href="./documentation.html">documentation</a>, and
						<a href="http://www.github.com/BattleEx/Project">the source code</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The documentation link should give you everything you need to know about
						both the application and the framework sections of the code.
